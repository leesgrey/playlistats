Generates Spotify playlist statistics

---

> Due to the nature of Spotify's [development mode](https://developer.spotify.com/community/news/2021/05/27/improving-the-developer-and-user-experience-for-third-party-apps/), only manually-authorized users can use playlistats currently (hoping to create a demo version and apply for Extended Quota soon!)
